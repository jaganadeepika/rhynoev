      <h1>Rhyno EV Refund Policy</h1>
      <p>At Rhyno Electric Vehicle, we strive to ensure that our customers are fully satisfied with their purchases. Our refund policy is designed to provide clear guidelines on the conditions under which refunds are granted.</p>
      <h3>Refund Eligibility</h3>
      <p>To be eligible for a refund, the following conditions must be met:<br/>
      <li> <strong>Standard Refunds:</strong> Customers may request a refund within 30 days of the original purchase date for any unused and undamaged vehicle. The vehicle must be returned in its original packaging along with all accessories, manuals, and documentation.</li>
      <li> <strong>Defective or Damaged Vehicles:</strong> If a vehicle is found to be defective or damaged upon delivery, customers are eligible for a full refund or replacement. Proof of the defect or damage must be provided within 7 days of receiving the vehicle.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-Orders and Special Orders:</strong> Refunds for pre-ordered or specially ordered vehicles are only available if the vehicle has not yet been shipped. Once shipped, these orders are non-refundable unless the vehicle is defective or damaged upon delivery.</li>
       </p>
    <h3>Non-Refundable Items</h3>
    <p>Certain types of goods are exempt from being returned:<br/>
    <li><strong>Used Vehicles:</strong> Vehicles that have been used or show signs of wear and tear are not eligible for a refund.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessories and Parts:</strong> Individual accessories and parts are non-refundable unless they are defective or damaged upon receipt</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Modifications:</strong> Vehicles that have been customized or modified as per customer requests are non-refundable</li></p>
    <h3>Refund Process</h3>
    <p>
    <li><strong>Initiating a Refund:</strong> To initiate a refund, customers must contact our customer service team at [Customer Service Email] with their order number and reason for the refund request. Our team will provide further instructions on how to proceed.</li>
    <li><strong> Return Shipping:</strong> Customers are responsible for the return shipping costs unless the vehicle is being returned due to a defect or damage. It is recommended to use a trackable shipping service or purchase shipping insurance for items over $75.</li>
    <li><strong> Inspection and Approval:</strong> Once the returned vehicle is received and inspected, we will notify the customer of the approval or rejection of the refund. If approved, the refund will be processed and a credit will automatically be applied to the original method of payment within 10-15 business days.</li></p>
